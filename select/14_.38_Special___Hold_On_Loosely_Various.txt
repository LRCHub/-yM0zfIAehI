You see it all around you
Good lovin' gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had

And my mind goes back to a girl I met
Some years ago who told me

Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

So damn easy
When your feelings are such
To overprotect her
To love her too much

And my mind goes back to a girl I met
Some years ago who told me

Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

Don't let her slip away
Sentimental fool
Don't let your heart get in the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You see it all around you
Good lovin' gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had

So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
Hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly to her, you're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah
