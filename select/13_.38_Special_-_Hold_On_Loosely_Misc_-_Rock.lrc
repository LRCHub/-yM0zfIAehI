[00:16.82] You see it all around you
[00:20.53] Good lovin' gone bad
[00:24.53] And usually it's too late when you
[00:28.08] Realize what you had
[00:38.08] 
[00:31.65] And my mind goes back to a girl I met
[00:35.49] Some years ago who told me
[00:48.49] 
[00:39.55] Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
[00:46.89] If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
[00:54.57] Your baby needs someone to believe in
[00:58.58] And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[01:17.58] 
[01:02.28] So damn easy
[01:05.50] When your feelings are such
[01:09.83] To overprotect her
[01:13.47] To love her too much
[01:23.47] 
[01:16.87] And my mind goes back to a girl I met
[01:20.86] Some years ago who told me
[01:33.86] 
[01:24.91] Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
[01:32.14] If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
[01:40.12] Your baby needs someone to believe in
[01:43.87] And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[02:02.87] 
[01:49.61] Don't let her slip away
[01:53.85] Sentimental fool
[01:57.08] Don't let your heart get in the way
[02:00.73] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[02:08.73] 
[02:03.49] You see it all around you
[02:07.05] Good lovin' gone bad
[02:11.17] And usually it's too late when you
[02:14.42] Realize what you had
[02:24.42] 
[02:18.39] So hold on loosely, but don't let go
[02:25.68] If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
[02:33.70] Your baby needs someone to believe in
[02:37.41] And a whole lot of space to breathe in
[02:56.41] 
[02:41.00] So hold on loosely, but don't let go
[02:48.32] If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose it
[02:53.69] You're gonna lose control
[03:01.46] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[03:12.46] 
[03:10.82] So hold on loosely, but don't let go
[03:18.23] If you cling too tightly, you're gonna lose control
[03:25.35] Hold on loosely, but don't let go
[03:33.00] If you cling too tightly to her, you're gonna lose control
[03:38.62] Yeah, yeah, yeah
